I'm hoping this script can serve as a starting point to help automate getting VPC Flow Logs into Splunk via Kinesis Stream.

Virtual Hardware Used:
- t2.medium with AWS App + AWS App Add-on

Few notes:

- When running this script, you may have to wait a few minutes for the VPC Flow logs to generate inside of the Cloudwatch stream.
- The Splunk instance is also using the IAM Role (should be autodiscovered) set up during setup for the AWS Splunk app.

A few minutes after the script has ran, add a kinesis input under the AWS-Add on add.

If all is good, you should see some events in Splunk under the AWS App -> VPC Flow Logs - Traffic Analysis
